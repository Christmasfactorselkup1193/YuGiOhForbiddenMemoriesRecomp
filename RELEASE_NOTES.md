# Release notes

## 0.2.4

> **About 0.2.3:** it was published and withdrawn within about five minutes and
> was not stable — its launch-time update check silently disabled itself. If
> you happened to grab it, replace it with this build. Everything below applies
> to 0.2.4, and 0.2.3 is best treated as never having shipped.

**Read this if you are updating from 0.2.2 or earlier — it affects your saves.**

### Install this update over your existing folder

Extract this release **on top of your current install**, replacing the files
when Windows asks. That is the whole procedure, and it is what lets the game
find your existing saves.

On the first launch after that, the game copies your memory cards and save
states out of the game folder and into

```
Documents\My Games\Yu-Gi-Oh Forbidden Memories Recompiled
```

You do not have to move anything yourself. The originals are **copied, not
moved** — they stay in the old folder untouched, so nothing is lost if
something goes wrong or you want to go back.

### If you extracted somewhere else instead

Your saves are not gone. They are still sitting in your old game folder,
where every previous version kept them. Copy these from the **old** folder
into `Documents\My Games\Yu-Gi-Oh Forbidden Memories Recompiled`:

- `card1.mcd`, `card2.mcd` — memory cards
- the `saves\` folder (its `openbios\` subfolder holds your save states)

Then launch the game again.

### After this, updates stop being fragile

From 0.2.3 onward your saves live outside the game folder for good. Later
updates can be extracted anywhere — over the top, into a fresh folder, it no
longer matters, because nothing an update writes can reach them.

Before this change, saves survived an update only because the release archive
happened not to contain a `saves\` folder, and extracting into a new folder
silently left every save behind. That is what this release fixes.

Running the game off a USB stick or a shared machine? Put an empty file named
`portable.txt` next to the exe (or set `PSX_PORTABLE=1`) and everything stays
in the game folder as before.

### Also in this release

**Update notifications.** The game now checks for a newer release each time it
starts and offers to open the download page. It never downloads or installs
anything by itself. Set `update_check=0` in `menu_settings.ini` to turn the
check off entirely — with that set, no request is made at all.

**VIDEO > WINDOWED SCALE.** A new option under SCREEN, 1x to 8x, default 3x.
It resizes the window so the picture is an exact whole-number multiple of the
original 320x240 — at 3x that is a 960x720 picture with no blurring and no
uneven pixels. It applies when SCREEN is WINDOWED and SCALING is INTEGER; the
row says so when it is not.

**The menu bar no longer covers the game.** The picture was being drawn behind
the menu bar instead of below it, so the top of the screen was hidden and the
image sat off-centre. Maximising changed how much was covered but never fixed
it.
